Commandline Minesweeper
=======================


Make sure to 'gem install colorize' before playing.

In-game commands are:
 [x-coord] [y-coord] [f/u/s] [savename]
 
 f => flag
 u => unflag
 s => save to [savename]
 
 You still have to type a pair of coordinates even if you're just trying to save...
